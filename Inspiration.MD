 

## Inspiration
* **Tech**: I stumbled upon browser-based AI via google chrome blogs and thought, "Why not give it a try?" I was excited to discover that I didn't need to set up infrastructure, servers, or API keys. The Gemini Nano browser extension allows also for offline capabilities and doesn't send data off to unknown servers.

* **Functional Part**: As someone who uses AI daily for work and hobbies, I often find myself opening multiple tabs and windows. I sometimes get lost with too many browser tabs and windows open. It would be cool if I could seek AI for advice for overview and how to be more productive. Also, I thought, "What if I could keep my site open and highlight text to generate summary, meaning, synonym and comments easily?"  I downloaded many market AI Chrome extension, but it required signing up, limited access, or token-based trials. I was concerned about the privacy of my search queries too.
 

* **UX Part**:  I envisioned a side-panel mentor, like a sensei, to guide me. I thought, "Why not make it charismatic, like a Chinese kung fu master with long eyebrows & beard?" and.. "How about Sensei?" since i like karate kid

## What it Does

The app has three main features:

1. **Browsing Mentor**: Analyzes your browsing history and provides insights, helpful advice, and a motivational quote.
2. **Enlighten Mode**: Allows highlghtee text summary, meanng,synonym and urban dictionary.
3. **Insightful Contribution**: Generates customizable comments/replies for you.

## How We Built It

I referred to the documentations and offlne device Gemini Nano GitHub repo ,then played with different repos to understand how to call the API.

## Challenges We Ran Into

* **Personal**: Limited time and had to commit code quickly for a hackathon.
* **Technical**: API AI sessions canceled themselves when too many were running, and my slow PC processor slowed down when running multiple test codes.
Code organization is messy.

* **Technical**: I had many separated ideas, but decided to combine them into different context menu features.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

I'm proud to have created a Chrome extension for the first time and like the result. I also appreciate the offline AI capabilities.

## What We Learned

* Learning is always good.
* Testing is important to keep the app working.
* Prioritization and focus on features are crucial.
* Simplicity is key.

## What's Next for Web X Sensei: Enlightening Your Web Browsing Journey

I want to explore function-binding features (like how openAI function call and  LLaMA index tool callng) for browser navigation features. Somethng like allow user to prompt chat to perform finding or closing tabs that meet specific criteria.
